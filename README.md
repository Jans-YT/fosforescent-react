## Introduction

See [here](https://github.com/fosforescent/fosforescent-js) for the Fosforescent backend.  This repo is for the react-based web structural editor. 

Since the semantics of the backend are still in the design process, one goal is to keep this as generalizable as possible for use with other graph structures.
